I came back to github because of 42KL and found this repo where I helped farah for her fyp. There are things that I wish were different. For example me wanting to go to diploma sains komputer. But I was still young that time. I'm still young now if I measured my maturity. I still have a lot to learn and many more things that I want to achieve. For now like I dont know why I still stuck with her. Is it because I'm scared of being lonely? I have many brothers and sisters that have lived like 30+ years. I should work harder and pray more. I'm big already not a little kid anymore.
